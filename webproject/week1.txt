Week 1
On this week we found a site customer.
We will start to make the site of "Pinta" chain of bars and shops from Karaganda.
We drew the skeleton of the site and discussed it with the customer.
Than we have compiled a list of materials we need to get started.
Now we are waiting for sending files from the customer and we will start our work.
